# No_CheckPoints: Rage Game

This is my game. My first completely working 3d game, made on unity.
And, i am SO excited and happy that this game is available online publicly for all, for free!!
All you have to do in this game, is reach the very top. The level 1 is complete! You will soon be able to play the level 2 and the further level!!

It takes up roughly 100 MBs(90 MBs)
Around 70 mbs for the game. Around 20 mbs for the setup file.

It won't take up much space on your disk(considering, lapotp's usually have 100s of GBs of space)

Everyone, please do play this game....
