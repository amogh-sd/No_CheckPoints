# No_CheckPoints: Rage Game

This is my game. My first completely working 3d game, made on unity.
And, i am SO excited and happy that this game is available online publicly for all, for free!!
All you have to do in this game, is reach the very top. The level 1 is completely functional! You will soon be able to play the level 2 and the further level!!

# How to download:
Go to https://github.com/amogh-sd/No_CheckPoints
Then, click on the "Code" button, and when a dropdown comes, click on "Download ZIP"


It takes up roughly 100 MBs(90 MBs)
Around 70 mbs for the game. Around 20 mbs for the setup file.
(You can delete the setup file later on)

It won't take up much space on your disk(considering, lapotp's usually have GBs of space)

Everyone, please do play this game....
