# No CheckPoints: Rage Game

This is my game. My first completely working 3d game, made on unity.
And, i am SO excited and happy that this game is available online publicly for all, for free!!
All you have to do in this game, is reach the very top. The level 1 is completely functional! You will soon be able to play the level 2 and the further levels*!!

# How to download:
You can directly start the download by clicking on the following link- https://github.com/amogh-sd/No_CheckPoints/archive/main.zip

OR(this one is way ling, i would recomend u to choose the first option, which is what anyone whould do)

Go to https://github.com/amogh-sd/No_CheckPoints

Then, click on the "Code" button, and when a dropdown comes, click on "Download ZIP"
After the download is complete, extract all the files present in the folder(that will be the setup file, and maybe even this readME file)
Then navigate to the setup file, and click on it. The installation process is very simple. 

After the installation, you are free to play the game any time you want!


It takes up roughly 100 MBs(90 MBs)
Around 70(kinda less than that) mbs for the game. Around 20 mbs for the setup file.
(You can delete the setup file later on)

It won't take up much space on your disk(considering, lapotp's usually have GBs of space)

Everyone, please do play this game....

Also, if anyone faces any difficulty while the installation of the game, or while downloading the game, please contact me freely-
You can drop a mail at- amoghdhavalikar@gmail.com 
AND, just so you know, i also use hangouts, so if you are comfortable with that, you may use hangouts to ask your query.


BTW, this is the link to my website(um.. yeahh... not exactly.. kk..k.. k.. kinda!)- https://amogh-sd.github.io/MyWebsite/



*Umm... i will make the next levels for sure... but please consider that i am a 13 year old, i go to school, participate in extra curricular activities, learn coding, participate in competitive exams, etc, etc, etc. So, i am planning to proceed with the next level of the game in vacations, because i want it to be better than this one...
